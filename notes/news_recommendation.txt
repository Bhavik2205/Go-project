🔍 Recommendations for News Source for Trading Tool
Given your focus on analyzing news impact on specific companies, especially those listed in India and international markets:

Primary API Integration: Consider integrating Marketaux for its extensive coverage and entity tracking capabilities. Its ability to provide concise and relevant financial news makes it suitable for your use case.
Supplementary Data Sources: Utilize Finnhub and EODHD to enrich your dataset with real-time updates and sentiment analysis, respectively. This combination can enhance the accuracy of your sentiment predictions.
Regional Focus: For Indian markets, ensure that the APIs you choose provide adequate coverage of Indian companies. While Marketaux and Finnhub have broad coverage, verify the extent of their Indian market data.
News Validation: Cross-reference news articles from APIs with trusted platforms like Reuters, Bloomberg, and Yahoo Finance to validate the information and gain additional insights.


By integrating these sources, your trading tool can effectively fetch the latest news related to specific companies and assess potential impacts on their stock performance across various exchanges.
